### WEEK 1

### my_pkg_1 :
A publisher node and a subscriber node is created.  
The publisher node generates a random number in [1,100) and publishes it to a topic.  
The subscriber node subscribes to this topic and calculates square of the number. After this, it displays the square in terminal.  
I haven't used timer to repeatedly send numbers(only one number is transmitted), thus, 1st run subscriber node and then the publisher node.  
  
Thank you.

## **Temperature Warning**

This is a basic package i made for a practice.<br>

This package has 2 nodes. The publisher node generates random temperature values. The subscriber node checks if these values exceed a particular threshhold value. If it does, then it displays a warning message on terminal. The threshhold temperature value is assigned through parameter in launch file.  
I have also included default QoS profile and a launch file.

Thank you.
